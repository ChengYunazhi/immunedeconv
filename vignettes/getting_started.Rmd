This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# library(immunedeconv)
library(Biobase)

devtools::load_all("/storage/home/sturm/projects/immune_deconvolution_methods")

load(system.file("extdata", "fantom5_expression_set.rda", package="immunedeconv", mustWork=TRUE))

expr_mat = exprs(fantom5_expression_set)
rownames(expr_mat) = fData(fantom5_expression_set) %>% pull("hgnc_symbol")
r = deconvolute(expr_mat, "xcell")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
